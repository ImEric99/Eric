   <h3>Welcome Investors</h3>
   <p>Here I will introduce to you the things I have learned throughout my trading career. I have made both good and bad investments so this page will act as a journal for my trading journey to 100k. This sounds difficult especially with the amount of capital I'll be starting out with, however this is a challenge that I will accept. Hopefully you guys will be able to enjoy this journey with me. <br>This page is a <strong>WIP.</strong </p>

      <h1>|9/8/18| Options Trading is <span style="color:red">Risky</span> </h1>
    </section>
    <p>Who would have known that options trading would be <strong>100x</strong> more volatile than regular stock trading. There are factors such as <em>Implied Volatility </em> and the &quot <em>Greeks</em> &quot. I have made a decent amount from options, albeit I did lose most of it due to undisciplined trading. So what tips would I have to offer on options trading, first of all <strong>keep your positions small</strong> if you don't you will see a lot of red in your portfolio. A wise man once said to not bite off more than you can chew which especially applies to options trading. <br>
      
      <br>The second tip is: <strong>don't try to time the market.</strong> You will fail time and time again, until you understand this one fundamental of trading that the market does not care about you. It is either you make it your bitch or it will make you its bitch. What should you do instead? Be early on spotting trends and follow them for as long as you can make profits from them. Use your <strong>stop losses</strong> and remember to pull out once you see a significant market reversal against you.

     <h1>|9/10/18| The Importance of <span style="color:green">Smaller Positions</span></h1>
     <p>
       Big positions can result in either huge wins or devastating losses, which is why I tend to avoid them. In the past I've traded, in my opinion, relatively big options positions and since I only had a fair amount of capital it resulted in a large net loss of about $1000. I was devastated and it led me down a dark path in trading: emotional trading. Trading on emotions means allowing greed and anger to have priority over your reasoning and logic, which for a trader is never good. I kept losing money, but I also kept thinking that my next trade will be the huge jackpot like the ones those guys over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank">/r/wsb</a> has.  <br> <br>

So how did I overcome this personal recession? I started to trade smaller positions, which gave me more breathing room. With smaller positions you won't lose as much as bigger ones, especially with options trading. Although you will also be limiting your earning potential it is a good hedging tactic if you are unsure about price movements. Most importantly, I put my logic and reasoning over my emotions as you should too.

     <h1>|9/12/18| When in Doubt, <span style="color:blue">Hedge</span></h1>
     <p>
       If you are not fully confident in your trade, you should always hedge it so you can minimize your losses in the case that the trade doesn't go your way. With options trading you can sell naked calls to hedge your call positions, this is called creating a call spread. When you initiate a call spread you are buying, for example, 1 XYZ stock call option (Option A) with a strike price of $100 for $350 and also selling 1 XYZ stock call option (Option B) with a strike price that is greater than your first call option. Lets say that Option B has a strike price of $101 and you sold it for $275 then your potential profit will equal $25 (<b>the difference between strike prices - net cost of spread </b>). This method also reduces the upfront cost of buying the call option, therefore whenever you are not sure about your trade think about hedging it.
